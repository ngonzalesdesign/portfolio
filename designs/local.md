summary: These posters were created for a series of classes offered at a local library. The sugar scrubs' fun and fruity essence is reflected in this poster's bright, stylized illustration. The design for the cheese flyer used a layout based on repitition and the rule of thirds along with bright tones and illustrations to grab potentional attendees' attention and let them know what a fun time they'd have at this local cheesemaking class.
