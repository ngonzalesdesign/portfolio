Writing a book is like birthing an entire universe. You have to create the people, places, pets, plots, and countless other things that populate the story world. Keeping track of it all—especially if you’re writing a series—especially if you’re writing fantasy—can feel overwhelming.

Until I started using Scrivener for all of my writing, I used to have folders within folders within folders in an attempt to organize it all.

But now there’s a new tool in town that I think will make it even easier!
Enter Airtable

Airtable\* is a magical combination of spreadsheet, database, and rainbow-colored visual wonderland. This makes it the perfect tool for creating a story or series bible.

If you are at all a visual learner (raises both hands) then you will LOVE Airtable.

And the best part? Airtable is FREE!

You can, of course, upgrade for premium features. I promise you won’t need them. (But the additional color options are really fun.)
