summary: This revamp of the American 20 dollar bill showcases the long, multifaceted history of the US. The backside features a number of visuals including the American flag, the Civil War, the March on Washington, and a rocket launch, that create a more comprehensive look at the nation. Bright colors are used to give the currency a more artful, impactful look, but divided to keep from becoming overwhelming. Featured in the student gallery.
