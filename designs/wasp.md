summary: Cover design concept for Iain Banks’ The Wasp Factory, a novel the Irish Times called “a work of unparalelled deparavity.” The nature of the book is reflected in the color scheme which uses shades of green and yellow meant to evoke a certain sense of unease. Red rounds out the scheme to direct the viewer and create rhythm. The wasp’s markings are a reference to the clock that functions as the eponymous Wasp Factory in the novel, while the broken stinger functions as a focal point and another clue to the story’s themes. Featured in the student gallery.
