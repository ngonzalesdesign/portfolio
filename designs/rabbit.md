summary: These album covers for band Frightened Rabbit, both use the same illustration style and similar layouts and muted colors to create a cohesive look across the two. Both illustrations also provide dual representations, with the Winterâ€™s toothpicks forming a snowflake, and the cave in Loneliness doubling as an open mouth.
