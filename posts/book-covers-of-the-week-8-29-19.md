title: Book Covers of the Week - 8/29/19
date: 2019-08-29T19:27:19.374Z
summary: >-
  This book is a fantastic read, and I'm so glad it got a cover that did it
  justice. Jarrod Taylor's design truly reflects on story within, from the 50s
  pulp style to the spooky tentacles doubling as Klansmen which perfectly
  captures the book's use of racism as horror.

<h2 class="h5"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20694747-the-hoarders">The Hoarders</a> by Scott Herring</h2>

[David Drummond](http://daviddrummond.blogspot.com/)'s cover manages to convey the cluttered, claustrophobic feel of hoarding while still remaining clean and structured enough to be readable and attractive.

<h2 class="h5"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18142324-all-the-birds-singing">All the Birds, Singing</a> by Evie Wyld</h2>

By dividing the images into irregular shapes [Joan Wong](https://jowoho.co/) creates a sort of organized chaos on this cover, giving potential readers an idea of the tense narrative and fragmented style of the book.  None of the images of the sheep or field line up, while those of the wolf do, which, along with the wolf imagery's larger size and plain background, gives the cover a strong focus and visual hierarchy.

<h2 class="h5"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16278318-armada">Armada</a> by Ernest Cline</h2>

[Will Staehle](http://unusualco.com/) is one of my favorite designers, and this cover is a great example of why. There's so many smart things going on with this design, from the creation of the A using the armada and the carefully structured cityscape, to how the A's composition directs the viewer's eye and creates an  oppressive  barrier around the city.

<h2 class="h5"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20935190-the-boy-with-the-tiger-s-heart">The Boy With the Tiger's Heart</a> by Linda Coggin</h2>

This cover is one of the best examples of a "double exposure" look that I've come across. [Levente Szab√≥](https://www.briskgraphics.com/) makes use of this format a lot, and all his work is beautiful, but this one benefits the most from it. Rather than simply placing a background with another image's shape, it uses that background to help create the shape and coloring of the tiger, further connecting the two images.
